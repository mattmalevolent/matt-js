# Matt.js
*A powerful new JavaScript library for implementing nominative mathematical manipulation.*

I’ve written a lot of JavaScript over the years, and every time I use `Math.round()` it niggles at me that it’s *so* close to my name. Finally, in a fit of vanity, and by applying my vast technical experience, I've created Matt.js, a new project to address this issue.

## How to use Matt.js

Simply load the script file into your page, e.g. with

```
<script src="Matt.js"></script>
```

and you can then replace `Math` with `Matt` throughout your code, finally allowing the use of `Matt.round()` and thereby making everything right in the world.

## What if my name isn’t Matt Round?

Matt.js is equally useful for Matts with other surnames such as Floor, Abs, Log, Max, Pi and [many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math).
